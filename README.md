# Weather Dashboard
This project shows the weather for a city by using data from the Open Weather API. The user enters the name of the city in a form and the weather for the current day and the next 5 days are displayed to the user. The city the user searched for is saved in a search list and the user can view the weather for the city again by clicking on the city name in the search list. Data from the open weather API is retrieved by using the Javascript fetch function and the saved searches are stored using Javascript local storage.
